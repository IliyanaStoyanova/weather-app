# Weather App

## This website is for showing the weather.

### I use on the website:

- _Javascript_<br/>
- _HTML_<br/>
- _CSS_<br/>
- _Bootstrap_<br/>

**What's the idea?** <br/>
The website lets you set up a location and display the weather.

**Website features:**

- Set your location;
- Validate your location.

### Start the project
